📘 Synthetic AI SOC

AI-powered Synthetic Security Operations Platform — LLM-driven analyst co-pilot with synthetic telemetry, anomaly detection, and attack simulation.
Zero enterprise data. Fully open-source.

🚀 Overview

Synthetic AI SOC is a modular, open-source platform that simulates enterprise-like telemetry and security attacks, applies ML/UEBA-based anomaly detection, and uses LLMs to generate high-quality analyst insights and triage summaries.

It allows you to demonstrate end-to-end expertise in:

AI/ML for threat detection

UEBA & anomaly modeling

LLM reasoning for SOC analysts

Real-time ingestion & backend architectures

Detection engineering & behavioral security

Full platform/system design

All data is synthetic, generated entirely by the platform’s simulation engine. No enterprise or sensitive data is used.

🏗 Architecture (MVP)
[Synthetic Log Simulator] 
     → [Ingestion Layer] 
     → [Stream Processor] 
     → [Feature Store + Embeddings] 
     → [Anomaly Scoring Service] 
     → [Alert Store] 
     → [LLM Reasoner / RAG] 
     → [Web UI Dashboard]

✨ Key Features (MVP)

Synthetic log generator (auth, process, network, MITRE-style attack sequences)

Real-time ingestion pipeline (Kafka or simple queue fallback)

Online UEBA-style anomaly detection (Isolation Forest + baselines)

Alerts API (FastAPI) + Postgres store

LLM-powered explanation service (RAG + structured incident summaries)

Lightweight React dashboard for viewing alerts

🧪 Quickstart (local dev)
docker-compose up --build

# In a separate terminal:
python simulator/sim_generator.py | python ingestion/producer/send_to_kafka.py

# Simple local scoring pipeline (no Kafka)
# Terminal 1: start anomaly service (from anomaly-service/)
#   uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8001
# Terminal 2: run simulator and ingestion->scoring
#   python simulator/sim_generator.py | python ingestion/ingest_and_score.py


Then open:

👉 http://localhost:3000

to view alerts in the dashboard.
